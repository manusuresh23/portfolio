                                    As a student of HCI, I learnt to think in terms of solution and not problems. A good design is one which can be understood without any instructions. Designing while keeping an eye on the constraints is important.
                                    Sketching lets me explain my ideas in a way that is easy for others to understand.

                                    Ethnography often plays an important part in research in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. During my first semester, as a part of the Foundations of HCI course, I was part of a team which carried out a study on the user experience on Netflix. The main purpose of this study was to understand the problems faced by the user and to propose a design solution to make their experience better.
                                </p>
                                <h4 style="color:black">Data Collection</h4>
                                <p>Each member of our team conducted a field observation. Since the focus of our study was Netflix, our observation method was direct and active. From our observations, we prepared a set of interview questions and narrowed down the research question.
                                    We divided the users into user groups based on their motivation to use Netflix and each member of the team selected a user group to interview.
                                    A task-walkthrough was conducted that required the subject to search for a show with a set of criteria the team had decided beforehand.
                                </p>
                                <h4 style="color:black">Persona</h4>
                                <p>We developed Personas based on the data collected and the user groups. Each team member created a persona from the data collected during their interview and task-walkthrough.</p>

                                <p>Once we collaborated the findings from the task-walkthrough we found a common problem. The limited sorting and filtering options available on Netflix. We demonstrated the problem and our design solution with the help of storyboards</p>

This helps me relax and go to sleep after a long day of schoolwork and basketball practice. I prefer comedies that lift my mood or drama’s that lull me to sleep. However, I stay away from high-paced action clips because it raises my adrenaline and causes me to lose sleep. My friends often recommend shows as per their own preference. However, I rarely find something from their recommendations that fit my current mood and has appropriate run times that does not keep me up to late. I use the Netflix search box to find the shows recommended by my friends, which takes time when I am searching for several shows. When none of my friends’ recommendations suits me, I browse Netflix suggestions, where I rarely find something to watch. At that point, I look up at the smart phone’s clock and realize that I wasted 10 – 15 minutes. I then decide to watch something I have already seen. Of course, I will not enjoy it as much as something I have not seen before, but at least it will help me go to sleep."</i></p>

However, I stay away high-paced action clips because it raises my adrenaline and causes me to lose sleep. Netflix allows me to create my own category of shows by setting certain criteria. I created a category called “Bedtime”, where I set the genres as comedies and dramas, and the runtime as less than 40 minutes. I also created a list of my favourite actors and specified the release year as anything after 2012. Netflix populated my “Bedtime” category with content that fit my criteria. This makes it much easier for me to find something to watch from my preferred genres, something that is not too long that it keeps me up late, and that stars at least one of my favourite actors. If one day I decide to watch something with shorter or longer runtimes, I can simply modify the runtime setting in my category. Doing so will update the content in the category to reflect the new settings."</i></p>

                                    As user experience designers and researchers, we have all come across similar problems, especially while recruiting the right participants for a study. This is motivation behind Indago (search out, try to find/procure by seeking), an app that helps create a community of people who share an affinity for research. As a 4-member team, we worked right from the inception to the prototyping of the app. The service that Indago provides helps researchers to find the participants they need for their research studies, helps individuals find opportunities to participate in interesting and rewarding research.</br>

                            We planned to design the application keeping in mind the target audience. Researchers and organizations looking for participants for their study, participants who would like to volunteer for research studies. However due to time constraint we focused on individual researchers and participants and will be persuing organizational content as a future study.

                        <p class="p-padding">
                            The Bergen Swamp Preservation Society is an educational institution whose purpose is to conserve the flora and fauna of its Upstate New York properties. The societies three main priorities are</br>
                    <p class="p-padding bullets">
                        1.	To conserve the flora and fauna of the lands owned by the society.</br>
                2.	To offer schools, colleges, and accredited groups access for the purpose of research and study.</br>
            3.	To publish scientific and cultural information pertaining to the Society lands.</br>
        </p>
    </p>

<h4 style="color:black; padding-top: 10px;">Purpose</h4>

<p class="p-padding">
    As a team of six at RIT, we collaborated with the designer and developer of the new website for Bergen Swamp Preservation Society, to conduct an extensive usability study of the website. The website provided details about the membership, directions, events, photos and research interests.  The user experience and the how closely the website matches the user’s conceptual model was evaluated during this study. The study focused on potential usability issues on the website, collect participants feedback and suggestions with the result of improving the website. The results of the study indicated the general usability issues and suggests improvements.
</p>


<h4 style="color:black; padding-top: 30px;">Methodology</h4>
<p class="p-padding">
    The usability testing was an exploratory study, consisting of 5 participants. In addition to them, 2 other participants were used in pilot test to fine tune the tasks assigned to the participants during the final test. </br>
Each participant was given five tasks. The task order was shuffled between participants to counterbalance any results skewed by transfer of learning. Qualitative data was collected by asking participants question after each task and at the end of the entire session. To analyse the tasks quantitatively, we recorded the number of on clicks and time to complete the task. The task was considered complete when the participant decided to stop. The success criteria for the tasks were predetermined by the team and designer from the results of the pilot tests.</br>
At the end of the session, each participant was compensated with a $20 amazon gift card.

</p>

<h4 style="color:black; padding-top: 30px;">Setup</h4>

<p class="p-padding">
    Test sessions were conducted under controlled settings, in the usability testing lab, at the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences, Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Rochester, New York</br>
Morae Screen recorder and observer were used on the test system and observer systems respectively. A webcam was used to record the participants’ reactions to the tasks.

                            The urge to stay connected and updated led us to a world infested with wearables. The main objective of wearables is to not only convey the arrival or update of information, but also to change our interactions from heads down to face up. However, these devices and the interactions used to attend notifications emanating from them are still frowned upon owing to their attention-grabbing nature. Our study attempts to enhance the experience of receiving and attending to notifications by encouraging face-up interactions over their heads-down counterparts.

                            The project began with the exploration of suitable SoC components and circuits. One of the best possible out-of-box options available that suited the requirements was Particle.io’s Photon, a lightweight Wi-Fi bundle. In order to embrace a modular design, we chose a 150mAh Li-ion battery to power the entire setup. A 5v/100mA vibration motor and a bright 3V LED strip were used for vibration and light-based modalities respectively.

                            A total of 16 participants (9F, 7M) were recruited for the study. The user study was designed to capture the participant’s likeness and perceived effectiveness of the feedback modalities in both a social setting and a personal setting. It consisted of two phases and was carried out in public spaces such as the library and the cafe at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The first phase was designed to test how distracting the device is to people around the wearer of the prototype. The second phase tested different intensities of light and vibration to locate the ideal intensity that provided notifications without jarring the users out of their current activity.
